# Tabular data - Bivariate relationships I: Categorical-Categorical


We analyze two variables to find out if there might be some kind of association between them. Even though that may be difficult to clearly identify, bivariate analysis still helps reveal _signs_ of association that may serve at least to raise concern.

As before, the nature of the data allows for some particular analytical techniques, while also providing some limitations to our inferences. Let's see what we can visualize with the different combinations of data.

This time, I will use the [data about crime](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Data/4fs7-3vj5) from the Seattle Open Data portal. The file has been previously prepared and consists of around half a million rows:

```{r collect, eval=TRUE}
# collecting the data
link="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/data/raw/master/crime.RData"
load(file = url(link))
```


The columns available are:

```{r names, eval=TRUE}
# seeing the variable names
names(crime)
```

Let's see what kind of data we have:

```{r str, eval=TRUE}
# checking data types
str(crime,width = 50,strict.width='cut')
```

# Categorical-Categorical relationships

The main way to organize these relationships are the contingency tables. Let's select a couple of categorical variables:


```{r, eval=TRUE}
# contingency table of counts
(PrecintDaytime=table(crime$Precinc,crime$Occurred.DayTime))
```

The contingency table shows the concurrent counts for every category. Those tables can show either total or marginal counts or percents. However, when a table tries to hypothesize a relationship, you should have the _independent_ variable in the columns, and the _dependent_ one in the rows; then, the percent should be computed by column to see how the levels of the dependent variable varies by each level of the independent one, and compare along rows:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# computing marginal percent (per column) from contingency table
library(magrittr) # for %>%
(PrecDayti_mgCol=prop.table(PrecintDaytime,
                            margin = 2)%>%round(.,3))
```


The previous table shows you how the crimes that occur in a precinct are affected by the time they happen. So you need a plot that allows to highlight those differences accross time.

As you know, a table can not be plotted unless they are turned into a data frame:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#making a data frame from contingency table
PrecDaytiDF=as.data.frame(PrecintDaytime)
names(PrecDaytiDF)=c("precint","daytime","counts")

#adding marginal percents:
PrecDaytiDF$pctCol=as.data.frame(PrecDayti_mgCol)[,3]
```

Then, you have:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# head of data frame representing contingency table and marginals
PrecDaytiDF
```


Let's tell ggplot we will use daytime (x) by pctCol (y) and fill according to precinct:

```{r base, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
base1=ggplot(data=PrecDaytiDF, 
             aes(x=daytime, y=pctCol,
                 fill=precint)) # fill brings a legend
```

Then, you try some bar options. First, the **dodge** style:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
barDodge= base1 +  geom_bar(stat="identity",
                            position ='dodge') 
barDodge 
```

The second is the **stack** style:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
barStacked = base1 + geom_bar(stat = "identity",
                              position = 'stack')#default
barStacked 
```

The stacked version will help more than the dodged one as it reveals better the values in the contingency table, so we continue with adding some elements:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(scales)
barStacked= barStacked + geom_text(size = 5,# check below:
                             position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),# center
                             aes(label=percent(pctCol,accuracy = 0.1)))# percent format

barStacked = barStacked + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

barStacked
```

Since the precinct is nominal, and you see some marked differences along the rows, I can reorder its levels:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
PrecDaytiDF$precint=factor(PrecDaytiDF$precint,
                           levels=c("SOUTHWEST","EAST", "SOUTH","WEST","NORTH"))

```

Now, let me redo the last plot from the very beginning after the last change:

```{r, eval=TRUE}

base1=ggplot(data=PrecDaytiDF, 
             aes(x=daytime, y=pctCol,
                 fill=precint)) 

barStacked = base1 + geom_bar(stat = "identity",
                              position = 'stack')
barStacked= barStacked + geom_text(size = 5,
                             position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
                             aes(label=percent(pctCol,accuracy = 0.1)))

barStacked = barStacked + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

barStacked


```

Let me show you a more complex situation:

```{r table, eval=TRUE}
# contingency table with many levels:

(CrimeDay=table(crime$crimecat,crime$Occurred.DayTime))
```

This contingency table has one categorical variables with several levels, let's prepare turn the table into a data frame:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#making a data frame from contingency table
CrimeDayDF=as.data.frame(CrimeDay)
#renaming:
names(CrimeDayDF)=c("crime","daytime","counts")
#marginal
CrimeDay_mgCol=prop.table(CrimeDay,margin = 2)
#adding marginal
CrimeDayDF$pctCol=as.data.frame(CrimeDay_mgCol)[,3]
# result for ggplot:
head(CrimeDayDF,20)
```


Sometime, a simple contingency table does not need to be plotted in order to reveal salient relationships; bt in this case we need visual help to discover some association.

Last time, we turn the contingency table into a stacked barplot, let's try again:

```{r BADplot,eval=TRUE}
# bad idea
base2=ggplot(data=CrimeDayDF,
             aes(x=daytime,y=pctCol,fill=crime))
base2=base2 + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = 'fill') + 
        geom_text(size = 3, 
                  position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
                  aes(label=percent(pctCol,accuracy = 0.1)))
barStacked2 = base2 + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

barStacked2
```

This plot will need a lot of work, so using the previous plots may not be a good strategy.  

A first option you may have is to reproduce the table:

```{r plotTable_gg, eval=TRUE}
#new base
base3 = ggplot(CrimeDayDF, aes(x=daytime,y=crime)) 
# plot value as point, size by value of percent
tablePlot = base3 + geom_point(aes(size = pctCol*100)) 
# add value of Percent as label
tablePlot = tablePlot + geom_text(aes(label = percent(pctCol,
                                                      accuracy = 0.1,
                                                      suffix = "")),#no %
                                  nudge_x = 0.3,
                                  size=3)
tablePlot
```

...some more work:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# improving previous plot

tablePlot = tablePlot + theme_minimal() # less ink
tablePlot = tablePlot + theme(legend.position="none") # no legend
tablePlot
```



The plot looks nice, but unless the differences are clearly cut, you may see more noise than information, which distracts and delays decision making. Keep in mind that _length_ of bars are easier to compare than circle _areas_. Let;s go for a dodged barplot, but with the help of **facets**:

```{r facet, eval=TRUE}
# as usual for barplot (less info than base1)
base4 = ggplot(CrimeDayDF, aes(x = daytime, y = pctCol ) ) 

#the bars
bars  = base4 + geom_bar( stat = "identity" ) + theme_minimal()

# bar per day time with 'facet'
barsFa = bars + facet_grid(~ crime) 

barsFa
```

In the previous plot we respected the XY relationship, but this does not look like the crosstable; let's solve that:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# change x to our early Y
base4 = ggplot(CrimeDayDF, aes(x = crime, y = pctCol ) ) 
bars  = base4 + geom_bar( stat = "identity" ) + theme_minimal()
barsFa = bars + facet_grid(~ daytime)  # X
# trick
barsFa + coord_flip()
```


The type of crime is not ordinal, then we could **reorder** the bars:

```{r orderFacet, eval=TRUE}
# introducing "reorder""

#crime ordered by %
# new base
baseRE  = ggplot(CrimeDayDF, 
                 aes(x = reorder(crime, pctCol), #here
                     y = pctCol ) ) + theme_minimal()

barsRE = baseRE + geom_bar( stat = "identity" ) 
barsREFa = barsRE + facet_grid( ~ daytime) 
barsREFa= barsREFa + coord_flip() 


barsREFa
```

Let's annotate:
```{r, eval=TRUE}

barsREFa + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=7,angle = 20)) + 
           geom_text(aes(label=round(pctCol,2)),
                     nudge_y = 0.1)
```

Let's improve the annotation:
```{r, eval=TRUE}

barsREFa + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=7,angle = 20)) + 
           geom_text(aes(label=ifelse(pctCol>0.1,# condition to annotate
                                      round(pctCol,2),"")),
                     nudge_y = 0.1)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}

barsREFa + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=7,angle = 20)) + 
           geom_text(aes(label=ifelse(pctCol>0.1,# condition to annotate
                                      scales::percent(round(pctCol,2)),"")),
                     nudge_y = 0.1,size=3) + 
           scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1,suffix="")) +
    labs(title= "You can not feel safe any time of the day",
         subtitle = "Seattle, WA",
         caption = "Seattle Crime Data - Official open data portal",
         x="Crimes",y="%")

```

You can try playing with color gradient:

```{r heatDescending, eval=TRUE}
# heatplot
base  = ggplot(CrimeDayDF, aes(x = daytime, 
                               y = reorder(crime, pctCol), 
                               fill = pctCol*100)) 
heat = base +  geom_tile()

# grey intensity
heat = heat +scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", 
                                   high = "black")
heat = heat + theme_classic()

heat
```

Some little changes:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# improving heat plot

heat = heat + labs(y="Crime", "Time of day")
heat = heat + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, 
                                               vjust = 0.6), 
                      legend.title = element_blank(), #no leg. title 
                      legend.position="top", 
                      legend.direction="horizontal",
                      legend.key.width=unit(1, "cm"),
                      legend.key.height=unit(1, "cm")) 

heat
```

You can try a different palette:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# heatplot
base  = ggplot(CrimeDayDF, aes(x = daytime, 
                               y = reorder(crime, pctCol), 
                               fill = pctCol*100)) 
heat = base +  geom_tile()

# CHANGING COLORS
heat = heat +scale_fill_gradientn(colours = colorspace::heat_hcl(4))
heat = heat + theme_classic()

heat = heat + labs(y="Crime", "Time of day")
heat = heat + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, 
                                               vjust = 0.6), 
                      legend.title = element_blank(), #no leg. title 
                      legend.position="top", 
                      legend.direction="horizontal",
                      legend.key.width=unit(1, "cm"),
                      legend.key.height=unit(1, "cm")) 

heat
```

And alter the direction of the color:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# heatplot
base  = ggplot(CrimeDayDF, aes(x = daytime, 
                               y = reorder(crime, pctCol), 
                               fill = pctCol*100)) 
heat = base +  geom_tile()

# ALTERING DIRECTION
heat = heat +scale_fill_gradientn(colours = rev(colorspace::heat_hcl(4)))
heat = heat + theme_classic()

heat = heat + labs(y="Crime", "Time of day")
heat = heat + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, 
                                               vjust = 0.6), 
                      legend.title = element_blank(), #no leg. title 
                      legend.position="top", 
                      legend.direction="horizontal",
                      legend.key.width=unit(1, "cm"),
                      legend.key.height=unit(1, "cm")) 

heat
```

I think this may not be better than our last barplot, but it may work in other situations.
